### About
GodsEye is a Windows and Android based RAT (remote access tool). It's highly advanced and has been around for about 4 years now. While it's private, this repo will contain a stripped down version with less features (for free). As it's private and only has a small amount of Users, it's fully undetected on all virus recognition websites, platforms and services. It utilizes many techniques to stay hidden and prevent detection.

### How To Use
There are a few ways which the GodsEye can be used:
`Command line` Can be used on all Terminals for Windows and Android (best to use Termux for Android).  
`Social media` Can be used with commands via social media platforms (Instagram, Telegram and Discord).  
`Application` There's a GUI based application for Windows (8, 10 and 11) as well as for Android (10+).
